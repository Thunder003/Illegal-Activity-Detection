# Illegal-Activity-Detection

This work is a small part of the entire plan of project aimed originally at passionate startups. We were aiming to build-up a start-up that aimed to provide security solutions to government sector with the help of drones. We were using DJI pro-mini drone for this purpose which comes up with an app to automate the flight.

The code provide image compasion and differences. If the difference is higher than a specified thresold then it means there is some change occur and is an security threat.
