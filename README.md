# Illegal-Activity-Detection

This work is a small part of the entire plan of project aimed originally at passionate startups. We were aiming to build-up a start-up that aimed to provide security solutions to government sector with the help of drones. We were using DJI pro-mini drone for this purpose which comes up with an app to automate the flight. Drone will capture the images of the entire area and it will be feed to the software to detect the illegal activities (Like illegal consturction etc.)

The code provide image compasion and differences. If the difference is higher than a specified thresold then it means there is some change occur and is an security threat.

<b><i>Prior to this code, a map from all the images captured by Drone will be formed by using meta-data of images and Google map API. This part is not mentioned in this repository.</i></b>
